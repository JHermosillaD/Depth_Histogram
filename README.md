# Depth map Histogram visualization :robot:

> OpenCV implementation to display the histogram of depth maps.

## About
Depth maps use a single channel and have an image depth of 2 bytes, unlike the classic grayscale that ranges from 0 to 255. It can represent 2<sup>16</sup> different intensity values. These values can be representing the distance in millimeters, centimeters, etc. And they can be recorded by a rgbd camera or similar devices.
